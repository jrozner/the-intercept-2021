# The Intercept 2021

## Building

The code is built against `639e7ad494d93fc82159f9fe854041bc43a96d5f` of the esp-idf. Depending on when you're building it maybe safe to build against whatever the current release is but code for, I think, the ir challenges made it in that were built master and weren't compatible with 4.2 anymore.
